# salo-lang

salo lang is a my first simple language writen in ruby and created only for educational purposes

I write It like a training for my future project

The are a lot of things here are taken from ruby and scala

Actually almost all values in **salo lang** is ruby primitives

### Dependencies
- [ruby](https://github.com/ruby/ruby)
- [rly](https://github.com/farcaller/rly)

### How to run 
Simply go to folder with this project and run
```
ruby src/main.rb <path to salo program file>
```
It's actually far away from complete and have many problems as you can see from list below

### Todo list
- [ ] Fix operator precedence
- [ ] Make modules more flexible 
- [ ] Lambdas, arrays, booleans 
- [ ] Default values in functions
- [ ] Register based VM in C
- [ ] Documentanion 

It would great if you help with some of these probles.
